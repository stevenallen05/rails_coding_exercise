# Tribonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Tribonacci sequence, and
# characterized by the fact that every number after the first three is the sum of the three preceding ones  0, 1, 1, 2,
# 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81 ...
#
# With different initial values, the tribonacci sequence starts as a, b, c, a+b+c, a+2b+2c, 2a+3b+4c, 4a+6b+7c,
# 7a+11b+13c, ..., eg, a = 3, b = 1, c = 3, sequence is 3, 1, 3, 7, 11, 21, 39, 71, 131, 241, ...
